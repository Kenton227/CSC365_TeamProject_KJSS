## Project Description
Our team will work to develop a chess service, akin to Chess.com. We will store player statistics, games, and data surrounding them (move history, time controls, etc.). There will be a leaderboard featuring players sorted by an ELO score and a match history for players to record their previously played games, as expected from many existing chess services. Our newest addition to this classic formula will be a feed where players can post snippets of their games, so players can show off particularly funny or brilliant sequences. These posts enrich our community members by being an avenue through which players can build bonds and study specific positions. Our project is also easily re-scalable, allowing us to aim for a greater or lesser complexity in the amount of data handled. Our team hopes to ultimately develop a hub for casuals fans of chess and chess aficionados to share their experiences, bond with fellow members of our platform, and learn more about the beautiful, simple "game of pawns and kings".
