# Chess Site Edutainer Showcase Posting Flow
Adding a game -> Posting -> Reporting negative comment
Levy Rozman from GothamChess just had an incredibly close game on his climb to GM and he wants to share his game with the world and use his game as an example of crucial endgame theory. First, Levy will log his game into his history using POST ```/user/games/{user_id}/submit```. He will then be able to find this most recent game in his history when he calls GET```/user/games/{user_id}```. From here, he can create a showcase based on this great game, and post it using POST```/showcases/post```. But whoops, Levy accidentally posted the showcase without any captions. Luckily, instead of deleting the showcase and posting a new one about the same game, Levy opts to just edit the newly posted one, hoping no one's feed has already received it, with PUT```/showcases/edit/{showcase_id}```. Now, Levy has finished sharing his game with the world!

# Community Member Sharing Showcase Flow

# Reporting Obviously Fake Account Flow
Find suspicious showcase -> check account's post and match history -> report account
Upstanding community member Sherlock Holmes was scrolling through his feed one day and found a very interesting showcase posted by Cat Branchman. It was a very impressive sequence that was featured, but Holmes noticed something strange. Holmes uses the showcase to find the original game using GET```/games/{game_id}``` and examines the moves played by both players, which are rated only around 1200 Elo. Holmes being a professional player himself, noticed that the original showcase poster played suspiciously well for someone with his rating, and investigates further finding his games history with ```/user/games/{user_id}```. After checking out Cat Branchman's recent win rate, Holmes also checks out Branchman's showcase history to confirm a suspicion using GET```user/showcases/{user_id}```, and, as expected all of these suspicious games were also used for showcases. So, Holmes files a report against the account and a few of the showcases by calling POST```/reports
